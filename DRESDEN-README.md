// From a macro or console
actor.rollSpell({
    power: 4,        // Power level to attempt
    element: "fire", // Element: fire, air, earth, water, spirit
    type: "attack",  // Type: attack, block, maneuver
    bonus: 0         // Any bonuses to rolls
});
```

#### Social Conflicts

actor.rollSocial({
    skill: "Intimidation", // Or Rapport, Deceit, etc.
    approach: "attack",    // attack, maneuver, or block
    bonus: 0
});
```

#### Stress Checks

## Magic System Details

### Evocation Process
1. **Gather Power**: Roll Conviction + 4dF
2. **Control Power**: Roll Discipline + 4dF
3. **Check Control**: If control < power, take backlash
4. **Apply Effect**: Use controlled power for effect

### Willpower Usage
- Spend willpower to boost rolls
- Limited resource that doesn't refresh easily
- Critical for powerful magic

### Backlash
When you fail to control a spell:
- Take mental stress equal to uncontrolled power
- Can be mitigated with consequences
- May cause collateral damage (GM discretion)

## Recommended Modules
- **Dice So Nice**: For 3D dice animations
- **Token Action HUD**: Quick access to spells and skills
- **Combat Utility Belt**: Enhanced combat tracking

## Tips and Tricks

### For Players
- Keep track of your willpower carefully
- Consider consequences before big spells
- Use aspects for declarations and compels
- Remember social conflicts are just as powerful

### For GMs
- Use the compendium NPCs as templates
- Set scene aspects for locations
- Track faction relationships
- Use the Action Tracker for conflicts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Compendiums not loading**: Run the import script manually
2. **Dresden tab missing**: Check actor type is "dresdenrpg"
3. **Rolls not working**: Ensure dresden-rolls.js is loaded
